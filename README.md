+ This repository contains four Jupyter Notebooks that showcase different machine learning applications. The notebooks included are:

## Face Mask Detector
Reimplementation of a Paper
Stock Price Predictor
Rock Paper Scissors Using Computer Vision
Each notebook demonstrates different aspects of machine learning, from computer vision to time series analysis.

The Face Mask Detector notebook showcases the use of computer vision to detect whether or not a person is wearing a face mask. The notebook uses the OpenCV and Keras libraries to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images as either **with mask** or **without mask**

The dataset used to train the model was obtained from Kaggle.

## Reimplementation of a Paper
The Reimplementation of a Paper notebook demonstrates how to reproduce the results of a research paper. The paper selected for this notebook is titled [insert paper title]. The notebook uses PyTorch to implement the model and reproduce the results presented in the paper.

## Stock Price Predictor
The Stock Price Predictor notebook shows how to use time series analysis to predict stock prices. The notebook uses the 4 datasets (**FPT, MSN, PNJ, VIC**) and then applies some simple model (**linear, LSTM, GRU**) to predict future prices.

## Rock Paper Scissors Using Computer Vision
The Rock Paper Scissors Using Computer Vision notebook demonstrates how to use computer vision to create a machine learning model that can recognize hand gestures. The notebook uses the OpenCV and Keras libraries to train a CNN to recognize the gestures for rock, paper, and scissors.

The dataset used to train the model was obtained from Kaggle.

## Requirements
To run these notebooks, the following libraries are required:
+ OpenCV
+ Keras
+ PyTorch
+ Pandas
+ NumPy
+ Matplotlib
+ Tensorflow
+ Jupyter notebook
+ Python >= 3.6

## Conclusion
Overall, these notebooks serve as examples of the different ways in which machine learning can be applied to various problems. By studying and experimenting with these notebooks, users can gain a deeper understanding of the machine learning process and develop skills in data analysis, model building, and more.
